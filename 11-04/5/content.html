<h1>Tags</h1>

<p>Pinterest wants to build an internal tool that lets them see the amount of
time at least 1 user was viewing pins of a particular tag. A pin is a unit of
content on Pinterest and a tag is a word that describes the pin. Pins can have
multiple tags each. Pinterest has tasked you with building this tool. Lucky for
you, Pinterest has given you enough data to work with in order to build it.</p>

<p>You will first be given each pin ID and a list of its tags. Then you will be
given a series of time intervals along with a pin id, where the time interval
represents the time frame a particular user was viewing that pin. Lastly, you
will be given a series of tags. For each tag, output the amount of time there
was at least 1 user viewing pins of that tag. If no users viewed pins of that
tag, output 0.</p>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p>The first line of input will be an integer T, the number of test cases. The
first line of each test case will contain three integers, N, M and Q. N
represents the number of pins, M represents the amount of data (time ranges
that a pin was viewed for) that Pinterest will give you and Q represents the
number of tags that will be queried for this tool. The next 2*N lines will each
contain the pin id (int) and the list of tags (strings) for that pin id. The
next M lines after that will each contain 3 integers, the pin id, the start of
the time range and the end of the time range.  Note that the time range, [A,B],
is inclusive. This means that times A and B are included in the range [A,B].
The next Q lines will each contain a single string, the tag being queried.</p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p>For each tag in each test case, print the amount of time that pins with that
tag were being viewed by at least 1 user.</p>

<h4>Constraints</h4>
<pre>
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= M <= 500
1 <= Q <= 10000
1 <= Number of tags <= 1000
0 <= A <= 1000
1 <= B <= 10^9

<h4>Sample Output</h4>

<h4>Sample Output Explanation</h4>

<p>In the first test case, we only have 1 query, which is for tag "cats". We
know that pins 1 and 3 both have the cat tag, so we first must find the viewed
time ranges for those pins, [10, 20] and [12,24]. The time at least 1 user was
viewing pins of the tag "cats" is 15, so we output 15.</p>

<p>In the second test case, we only have one query which is also for tag
"cats". Once again, pins 1 and 3 have the tag "cats" and have been viewed at
time ranges [10, 20], [1,5] and [12, 24]. The amount of time covered by these
ranges is 20, so we output 20.</p>
