<h1>Trees</h1>

<p>You've recently become interested in pictures of trees. You've found several
pictures of nice trees on Pinterest, and you want to show them to your friends.
Unfortunately, your friends don't have Pinterest! You can only communicate with
them via limited text protocols, so you want to find a way to represent your
trees as strings of text so your friends can enjoy them too.</p>

<p>Specifically, each tree is unrooted and labeled. You decide on encoding your
tree (with N nodes) as a unique sequence of N - 2 integers, called a
Pr&uuml;fer sequence. A Pr&uuml;fer sequence is constructed by, at each step
(until there are only two nodes remaining), removing the leaf node with the
smallest label (labels are integers between 1 and N) and appending to the
sequence the label of that node's neighbor.</p>

<p>For example, the Pr&uuml;fer sequence for the following tree is [1, 1, 5].</p>

<p>Given some trees, can you encode them as Pr&uuml;fer sequences so that you can
send them to your friends?</p>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p>The first line of input contains a single integer T, the number of test
cases. T test cases follow.</p>

<p>Each test case begins with a single line containing N, the number of nodes
in the tree. N - 1 lines follow, describing the edges of the tree (recall that
the nodes are labeled with integers from 1 to N). Each edge is given as a pair
of space-separated integers U and V, denoting the two endpoints of the edge.
All the edges are undirected.</p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p>Your program should output T lines, one for each test case. The output for
a test case should be a space-separated sequence of N - 2 integers, the Pr&uuml;fer
sequence for the given tree.</p>

<h4>Constraints</h4>

<pre>
1 <= T <= 20
3 <= N <= 1000
1 <= U, V <= N
</pre>

<h4>Sample Input</h4>

<pre>
1
5
4 5
5 1
1 2
3 1
</pre>

<h4>Sample Output</h4>

<pre>
1 1 5
</pre>

<h4>Explanation</h4>

<p>This is the example described in the problem statement. We first remove node
2 and append a 1 to the sequence, then we remove node 3 and append another 1,
then we remove node 1 and append a 5. There are only two nodes remaining, so we
are done.</p>
