<h1>Business</h1>

<p>Derek is looking to build a business on Pinterest using Pinterest's new
buyable pin feature (you can buy items displayed in pins). Pins are units of
content on Pinterest. Derek wants this to be an arts and crafts business, but
he doesn't know any of the business side and wants you to keep track of all
things money and inventory. Given the appropriate information regarding Derek's
business, and a series of orders for some of his buyable pins, can you
determine how much Derek will profit in total?</p>

<p>Each buyable pin that Derek owns will be an arts and crafts project. Each
project (pin) will have a required list of crafts and will use exactly 1 unit
of each resource required for that craft (this applies to EVERY craft that he
makes). Each resource for a craft is sold in packages. A package contains some
number of items and a price so Derek can buy in bulk (i.e. 2 bottles of glue
for $10 total). Derek originally starts out with 0 of each resource, and you
must purchase enough packages to fill each order. If you have remaining
supplies after an order, you may use them for a future order that requires
those supplies. The profit of Derek's business is determined by his total
revenue minus his total costs.</p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>The first line of input will be an integer T, the number of test cases. The
first line of each test case will contain three integers, N M and O. N
represents the number of buyable pins that Derek will have, M represents the
number of packages that Derek can buy and O represents the number of orders for
his pins. The next 2*N lines will contain a string, an int and a list of
strings, representing the pin name, price and the supplies required to build
the craft for the pin. The next M lines will contain a string and two integers,
where the string represents the name of the supply and the two integers
represent the amount in bulk you can buy of that supply and the price Derek
will pay for the supply. The next O lines will each contain a string and an
int, where the string represents the pin name that a customer has ordered and
the int represents the NUMBER of that pin that the customer ordered (i.e. if
the pin displays a pair of shoes, and the customer wants multiple pairs of the
shoes, he can buy more than one pair at a time).</p>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>For each tag in each test case, print out the profit that Derek will make
from his business.</p>

<h4>Sample Output Explanation</h4>
<p>For the first order, we will need enough supplies for two FRAME1s. To get
this, we must buy 1 bulk of GLUE (comes with 2) for $3, 2 bulks of GLITTER for
$4 total and 1 bulk of WOOD for $4 total. This brings our total costs to $11.
Then, after the order, we use 2 of our GLUE, 2 of our GLITTER and 2 of our
WOOD. Our next order is 1 FRAME1. This will require 1 GLUE, 1 GLITTER and 1
WOOD. Since we have 0 GLUE and 0 GLITTER, we will need to buy one bulk of each
for $3 and $2 ($5 total). Since we have 1 WOOD left over from the previous
purchase, we don't need to buy more wood. This brings our total costs to $16.
We then use one of our WOOD, GLUE and GLITTER each to complete the order. For
our last order, 2 FRAME2s, we will need 2 GLUEs and 2 WOODs. We have 1 GLUE
remaining from the previous order, but we still need one more and so we will
have to buy another bulk of GLUE for $3. We then have to buy one 1 package of
WOOD for $4, which brings our total cost to $23.</p>

<p>Once we have the total costs, we can simply subtract that from our total
revenue, which is 2*10 + 1*10 + 2*5 = 40. Our total profit is 40 - 23 = 17,
which means we output 17.</p>
