<h1>Pinergy</h1>

<p>Pinterest is testing a new type of page which requires positive pinergy (pin
+ energy). To view a page that requires positive pinergy, your network request
needs to build up S pinergy before it reaches the server with the final
page.</p>

<p>A network request begins at your computer, goes through a DNS lookup, then
all over the world until it reaches Pinterest's servers. To simplify the
internet for the purposes of this problem, we just give a list of servers and
the connections between them. A request begins at server 1, and can travel
between various servers. The connections between the servers effect the pinergy
of the request. The request begins with 0 pinergy.</p>

<p>See if it's possible for your request to travel from server 1 to server N
with pinergy at least S. Note that it's possible to arrive at server N, build
up some additional pinergy, and then go back to server N.</p>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p>The first line of the input will be a single integer T, the total number of
test cases.</p>

<p>Each test case begins with three space separated integers, N, M and S, the
number of servers, the number of connects, and the target pinergy. Following
that are M lines, each with space separated integers U, V and W, the beginning
and end of a server connection, as well as the change the server has on the
pinergy the road has on your speed.</p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p>For each test case print "YES" if there is a path the packet can take from
server 1 to destination N that has final speed greater than or equal to S.
Otherwise, print "NO".</p>

<h4>Constraints</h4>

<pre>
1 <= T <= 15
1 <= N <= 150
0 <= M <= 2000
25 * N <= S <= 1,000,000,000,000,000,000
1 <= U, V <= N
-20 <= W <= 20
</pre>

<h4>Sample Input</h4>

<pre>
2
5 5 140
1 2 20
2 3 20
3 4 20
4 2 20
4 5 20
3 2 100
1 2 20
2 3 20
</pre>

<h4>Sample Output</h4>

<pre>
YES
NO
</pre>

<h4>Explanation</h4>

<p>The packet can go from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to
5 will end with total pinergy 140, which is the target. In the second case,
there is only one path with pinergy 40, so you cannot reach pinergy 100.</p>
