<p>The X men are trying to break into Magneto's apartment, but they can't figure
out how to use their intel to deduce Magneto's key.<p>

<p>Magneto's lock is an M by N matrix. To gain entry into an apartment, the X men
need to figure out the values for every cell in the matrix. A double agent has
provided the X men with the values of the matrix, but compressed the data using
the Yale scheme.</p>

<p>The Yale scheme takes matrix with M rows and N columns and compresses it
into 3 arrays: A, I, and J. A contains the non-zero values of the matrix read
in row-major order (left to right, top to bottom). J is the same length as A
and has the column that each element of A appears in. I has (M + 1) values.
I[0] is always 0 and I[x] = I[x - 1] + (the number of non-zero elements in the
x'th row of the original matrix).</p>

<p>Given M, N, A, I, and J, can you construct the original matrix?</p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>The first line contains a positive integer T - the number of test cases.</p>

<p>Each test case consists of four lines. The first line contains 2 space-
separated integers: M, the number of rows in the matrix, N, the number of
columns in the matrix.</p>

<p>The second line contains (M + 1) space-separated integers, the elements of I.</p>
<p>Let L be the number of non-zero entries in the matrix.</p>
<p>The third line contains L space-separated integers, the elements of A.</p>
<p>The fourth line contians L space-separated integers, the elements of J.</p>
<p>Note that it's possible that A and J contain 0 elements.</p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p>For each test case, print M lines of N space-separated integers: the values of
the original matrix. Do not print extra spaces at the beginning or end of
lines, and do not print blank lines between matrices.</p>

<h4>Constraints</h4>

<pre>
1 <= T <= 500
1 <= M, N <= 1,000
