<h1>Wedding</h1>

<p>You've been planning your wedding on Pinterest for ages, little did you know
that your best friend would get married before you! Being the friend that you
are, you want to plan your friend's wedding using your Pinterest board. You
have some number of wedding activities on your Pinterest board. Each activity
a_i has some excitement value e_i and some cost c_i. As the wedding goes on the
excitement of the bride is equal to the sum of all of the activities that she
has participated in, including an activity that she might currently be
participating in. Her excitement before the wedding is 0, and her excitement at
the end of the wedding should be equal to the sums of the excitement values for
all of the activities. Note that you can use an activity as many times as you
like (the guests aren't easily bored!), though you must pay the cost each time
you plan the activity.</p>

<p>You want to plan the activities such that:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The excitement of the bride at the end of the wedding is exactly equal
        to some value G</li>
    <li>The excitement level of the bride at no point during the wedding
        exceeds some value M (note that it may be equal to M) so that the happy
        couple doesn't get overwhelmed</li>
    <li>The total cost of all of the activities that you use doesn't exceed
        some value T (note that it may be equal to T)</li>
</ol>

<p>Since this problem sounds like a lot of math you decide to write a program
to determine whether or not it is possible to plan such a wedding, and if it
is, what all of the different activity orders could look like.</p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>The first line of each test case begins with a single integer Z, the number
of test cases. The Z test cases each start with a line containing an integer
and three doubles, the number of activities you have pinned (A), and then G, M,
and T as described above.</p>

<p>The next A lines each start with a string representing the name of the
activity that you are considering followed by the amount of excitement the
activity gives (as a double), and the cost of the activity (as a double),
delimited by a single whitespace. All double values will have exactly two
decimal places. The name of the activity will contain only lower case
letters.</p>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>Begin each test case with a line "CASE: N" where N is the one indexed case
number. Then print out each unique wedding that you could plan on a new line. A
unique wedding is defined as a wedding where there are no other weddings of the
same length that have the same activities in the same order. Sort the potential
weddings such that the weddings that contain the fewest number of activities
are printed first. After that print the weddings out such that their string
representations are in alphabetical order. The string representation of a
wedding is the name of each of the activity in order with " -> " printed
between each activity. If it is not possible for you to plan such a wedding,
print out "IMPOSSIBLE". Print a single blank line at the end of each test
case.</p>

<h4>Constraints</h4>
<pre>
1 <= Z <= 10
1 <= A <= 5
1.00 <= G <= 10.00
1.00 <= M <= 20.00
1.00 <= T <= 8.00
-20.00 <= e_i <= 20.00 
1.00 <= c_i <= 10.00
</pre>

<h4>Sample Input</h4>
<pre>
1
2 7.00 10.00 10.00
vows 4.00 5.00
cake 3.00 5.00
</pre>

<h4>Sample Output</h4>
<pre>
CASE: 1
cake -> vows
vows -> cake
</pre>
