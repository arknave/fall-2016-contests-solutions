<h1>Balance</h1>

<p>Ben wants to look at a bunch of pins today, but he doesn't have the time!
He decides to enjoy some pins today, and some pins tomorrow.</p>

<p>There are N pins Ben wants to view, and each pin has an associated beauty
value B_i. Ben will not look at the same pin on both days, and he wants to be
sure to look at all the pins either today or tomorrow. More formally, for each
of the N pins, Ben will assign a day (today or tomorrow) on which he will view
the pin. Define the "balance" of such an assignment to be the absolute value
of the difference between the sums of the beauties of the pins he views on each
day.</p>

<p>Can you help Ben determine the minimum balance he can achieve by viewing
each pin either today or tomorrow?</p>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p>The first line of input will contain a single integer T, the number of test
cases. T test cases follow. Each test case is composed of two lines: the first
line contains a single integer N, the number of pins, and the second line
contains N space-separated integers B_i, the beauty values for each pin.</p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum balance Ben
can achieve.</p>

<h4>Constraints</h4>

<pre>
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 500
1 <= B_i <= 100
</pre>

<h4>Sample Input</h4>

<pre>
2
2
1 1
3
1 2 4
</pre>

<h4>Sample Output</h4>

<pre>
0
1
</pre>

<h4>Explanation</h4>

<p>In the first test case, Ben can view the first pin today and the second pin
tomorrow. This gives a balance of zero. In the second test case, Ben cannot
achieve a balance of zero: the best he can do is to view pins 1 and 2 today and
pin 3 tomorrow; this assignment gives balance 1.</p>
