<h1>Colors</h1>

<p>Pinterest wants to introduce a new type of search to their website: color
searching! Users can upload a hexadecimal color and find pins that are similar
in color. Unfortunately, you're the one assigned to build the feature, and you
need to get it done ASAP.</p>

<p>When a user searches for a color and topic, the machine learning team
figures out what pins the user would be most interested in. Each pin has a
color, and Your job is to lay out the pins from the color closest to the search
query.</p>

<p>A color is a 7 character string, where the first character is an octothorpe
/ hashtag ('#') followed by 6 characters, which can either be digits ('0' -
'9') or hexadecimal letters ('A'-'F'). Every two characters after the hashtag
form a byte (number in the range 0-255, inclusive), representing a color. The
first byte represents the red part of the color, the next byte represents the
green part of the color, and the final byte represents the blue part of the
color.</p>

<p>The "distance" from one color to another can be calculated by the Euclidean
color distance. If the first color has values r1, g1, b1 and the second color
has values r2, g2, b2, then the distance between the two colors is sqrt((r1 -
r2)^2 + (g1 - g2)^2 + (b1 - b2)^2).</p>

<p>Given a search query and a list of pins and their colors, print out the pins
from least distance to the query to greatest distance to the query.</p>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p>The input will begin with integer T, the number of test cases.</p>

<p>Each test case will begin with C and N, the query color and the number of
pins returned by the machine learning team. The next N lines will each contain
the color of a pin. All colors will be in the format listed above.</p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p>For each test case, print a line "Case C:" where C is the query color. After
that, print N lines, the pins given to you in order of color, sorted by the
colors closest to C. If two colors are the same distance, sort them
lexicographically (using your language's native string comparison function).
Do not print blank lines.</p>

<h4>Constraints</h4>

<pre>
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10,000
</pre>

<h4>Sample Input</h4>

<pre>
1
3 #FFFFFF
#ACDCDC
#EFFEFF
#DEADBF
</pre>

<h4>Sample Output</h4>

<pre>
Case #FFFFFF:
#EFFEFF
#ACDCDC
#DEADBF
</pre>

<h4>Explanation</h4>

<p>Sorted by the Euclidean color distance, this is the best ordering.</p>
